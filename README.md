The goal of the Coursera Capstone project is to build a Shiny application that is able to predict the next word. 

**Little Wordie-Teller** has thus been designed and deployed on shinyapps.io website [here](https://ayou.shinyapps.io/LittleWordieTeller/). It is a lightweight App built on a large corpus of textual data from *HC Corpora* provided by the Coursera website.

This repository contains ngrams tables produced from the textual data and the Rmarkdown file for the shiny app.
